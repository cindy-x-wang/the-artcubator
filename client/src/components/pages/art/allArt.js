She has studied art under Yunhua Fang for the past ten years. \n \n Connie specializes in charcoal and printmaking, but has recently developed an interest in acrylic painting and graphic design as well. The deeply introspective nature of her art allows her to process the world around her. Creating work is therefore a means by which she can reach new understandings about herself and her environment as they relate to psychology, cultural identity, and emotion. \n \n Her work has been recognized by the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards, as well as her local and state PTA. Additionally, she has been published in The Daphne Review (2019), Navigating the Maze (2019), and the Stanford Anthology for Youth (2017). More of her work can be found on her website.",
