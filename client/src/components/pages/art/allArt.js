She has studied art under Yunhua Fang for the past ten years. \n \n Connie specializes in charcoal and printmaking, but has recently developed an interest in acrylic painting and graphic design as well. The deeply introspective nature of her art allows her to process the world around her. Creating work is therefore a means by which she can reach new understandings about herself and her environment as they relate to psychology, cultural identity, and emotion. \n \n Her work has been recognized by the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards, as well as her local and state PTA. Additionally, she has been published in The Daphne Review (2019), Navigating the Maze (2019), and the Stanford Anthology for Youth (2017). More of her work can be found on her website.",

      "artistDescription": "Angela is a multidisciplinary artist majoring in Art History and Visual Arts at Barnard. Throughout her life, she has lived in multiple cities and studied at vastly different colleges, allowing her to develop a global and unique perspective while approaching her work. Her love for art and creativity began early; as a child, she entered into multiple painting competitions and won second place in North America at the United Nations Children Painting Competition and a Top Finalist in Canadian Portrait Society of Canada. In college, she really began to commit to her art more seriously and decided to move to New York to pursue her creative endeavors. Much of her art work’s style consists of highly illustrative narratives, painted with lively bold colors. Angela enjoys experimenting with incorporating different art styles, from traditional Chinese scroll paintings to Renaissance Portraiture. Because of the color palette, her work often alludes to a very bright and happy atmosphere, but upon closer inspection, offers more gruesome elements within. Feel free to connect with Angela over social media or check out her work at the links below.

      "artistDescription": "Katrina Liou is an artist and a student at Stanford University studying Product Design and Art Practice. Katrina’s work explores themes of imperfection, human anatomy and the human condition, often asking the question “What does it mean to be human?” Much of her work revolves around depicting the human body to explore the deeply hidden subtleties of the individual. In metaphoric imagery of human interaction, she searches for hints of character, personality, and hidden secrets to embed in the portrayal of flesh, folds of skin, wrinkles, and fat. Through this technique, she depicts the external elements as a display of internal emotion and personality. Examining the human condition through an anatomical lens allows her to engage in an interdisciplinary field that combines two seemingly disparate topics: art and science. At Stanford Katrina currently designs for Mint Magazine (Stanford’s culture and fashion magazine) and creates graphics for the Stanford Daily newspaper. Outside of school she also designs graphics of Hearts Over Hands, a volunteer organization that provides COVID-19 relief for families with young children.
